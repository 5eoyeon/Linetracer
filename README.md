# Linetracer
**Embedded System Design**  

Using TI-RSLK(based on 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F CPU), design a program to follow an Eulerian Circuit with single-stroke drawing.  
- Phase 1: Explore Eulerian trail  
An exploaratory phase to identify a valid Eulerian Circuit.
Navigate the Eulerian Circuit map and remember the path.
- Phase 2  
Based on the exploration in Phase 1, Linetracer must generate and follow a path that satisfies the single-stroke drawing criteria.
